**Camper Buddy** is a comprehensive e-commerce platform integrated with social features such as blogs and forums, designed specifically for camping enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a newcomer to the world of camping, Camper Buddy provides all the resources you needâ€”from essential gear to expert advice.

## Features
**E-Shop:**

**Authentication**
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up and log in either manually or via Google OAuth. Please note that we are using Auth20 for login and registration. However, since it is currently in Test Mode, access is likely restricted to specific email addresses that have been pre-registered. This means that only users with those pre-approved email addresses may be able to log in successfully during this phase.

**Order Management:**
- **Admin Controls**: Admin users can add new products, edit existing ones, manage orders, and change order statuses..
- **Email Notifications**: Receive automated email notifications for new orders and status updates.

**Blogs**
- **Curated Content**: Browse through a variety of blog posts related to travel, camping tips, and destination guides, all written by our admin.

**Forums (Under Construction)**
- **Community Engagement**: Participate in discussions, ask questions, and share experiences. While the forum is still under construction, stay tuned for future updates!
